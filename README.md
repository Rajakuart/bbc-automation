# 🧭 BBC Website E2E Automation Framework

A modular **Playwright + TypeScript** end-to-end automation framework for the **BBC Website**, built following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern.  
This framework includes **custom fixtures**, **reusable page objects**, and **typed URL constants**, providing a clean, maintainable, and scalable structure for UI test automation.

---

##  Features

- **Playwright + TypeScript** — Modern E2E testing with type safety  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** — Clear separation of test logic and UI interactions  
- **Custom Fixtures** — Shared setup and teardown for reusability  
- **Typed Constants** — Centralized URLs and credentials for consistency  
- **Screenshot & Storage Handling** — Save screenshots and browser session data  
- **Scalable Architecture** — Easy to extend and maintain as the project grows
